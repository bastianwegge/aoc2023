# Advent of Code 2023

The goal is to finish all challenges from the AoC 2023 using nvim and gopls without any external help. The result would be a usable setup for me personally to use nvim for professional development.

Priorities:
- Getting things done
- Writing a propper retrieval suite
- Writing a propper test environment
